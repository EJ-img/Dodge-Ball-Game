# Dodge-Ball-Game

This was my first computer programming project for my class CSCI 220. I Recreated a classic single-player platform game that allows the player to control a ball and dodge
accelerating blocks generated outside the screen. Every block dodged is added to a high score displayed at
the end of the game.
